    <span class = "info">Anil Parthasarathi is a senior Computer Science major attending&nbsp; <span class = tamucolor> Texas A&M University</span>. Expected graduation: May 2025.</span>

    <p class = "aboutme">Anil Parthasarathi was born on July 1st, 2003, in Fremont, California. Growing up in California, he attended Mission Valley Elementary School from 2008 to 2015. Beginning in third grade, Anil embarked on his journey training in martial arts. While practicing Taekwondo at Martial Arts America, Anil was instilled with values such as respect, self-esteem, confidence, and discipline. Ultimately, by middle school, Anil had achieved a black belt in the art of Taekwondo. Also, around this time, Anil began pursuing his interest in Computer Science through after-school coding courses. Through CodeWizardsHQ, Anil took his first step toward his future career path by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Anil began junior high in 2015 and attended one year at Hopkins Junior High before moving to Leander, Texas.</p>

    <p class = "aboutme">Upon moving to Texas in the summer of 2016, Anil enrolled in Stiles Middle School and then moved up to Vandegrift High School the following year. In the tenth grade, Anil took his first official school course in Computer Science, where he was introduced to core programming concepts through Scratch before progressing to his first encounter with Python. In the following two years, he learned Java and cybersecurity basics through his high school courses. During the 11th grade, Anil took part in the INCubatoredu entrepreneurship program at his school, where he collaborated with a team of peers to form a start-up business based around an original product. At the end of the year, the business became a finalist in the final pitch competition and earned the opportunity to receive funding. However, the team mutually chose to close the business due to logistical reasons. Meanwhile, Anil continued his training in martial arts by enrolling in Shaolin-Do Kung Fu, where he progressed to a brown belt by the end of high school. Anil graduated from high school in May 2021.</p>

    <p class = "aboutme">In August 2021, Anil started attending Texas A&M University College Station as a general engineering major. However, he knew from the beginning that he wanted to pursue Computer Science. Within the first year, he delved further into Python through the Engineering 102 course. The following summer, Anil&#8217;s ETAM application for Computer Science was accepted, and he officially became a Computer Science major that fall. Since then, he has gained more experience in C++, Java, Haskell, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in his classes, as well as learning important computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, recursion, discrete math, computer organization, and computer systems. In the summer of 2023, Anil interned with Skillbanc, where he learned the Dart programming language and applied it in mobile application development.</p>

    <p class = "aboutme">The following year, Anil began to take his first classes in computer graphics and AI inspiring great passion for both subjects. That summer, Anil interned with Kaidu AI, where he worked in C based embedded programming, python scripting, and machine learning model training to boost occupancy tracking performance. Anil expects to graduate in May 2025 and then begin a masters degree the following fall.</p>
